# loan_prediction

A classification problem where we have to predict whether a loan would be approved or not. This is an AV dataset from Kaggle.
I have used Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest to predict the Loan status as Yes/No. Logistic Regression seems to give an accuracy of 80% , i.e best accuracy among all the three models.
